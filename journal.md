# Jeffeth Donaldson's Card Games

## Intro

This project is a game where I'll create various card games I like to play with 
my family. The goal is to have a multiplayer enabled game that will allow me to
play card games with my family while I'm not living with them. 

Here are the games I'd like to implement, in the rough order I'd like to
implement them:
	#. Hand & Foot
	#. Ripple
	#. Spades

More information about the games will be in associated rules.md's
